# Talkies
An app for the movie buffs

## Basic features
- A simple Android app to show the latest movies and add wish lists for them. We use the TMdb API to create a list of latest movies. 
- Users can add these movies to their wish list and watch these movies later.
- Mark these movies as watched, as you move ahead.

## Features in future (Not yet planned, just imagination)
- Share the movies you watched on social media. 
- Add friends and recommend movies and TV shows to your friends.

## Project Installation
- [ ] Clone the repo from Github.
- [ ] Register in TMdb for your own API key to get the proper response
- [ ] Run the app on Android Studio

## Libraries and Tools used
- [ ] Android Studio (obviously)
- [ ] Retrofit for network calls
- [ ] Firebase for storing user data remotely
- [ ] Room ORM for storing user data locally in SQLite DB
- [ ] MVVM Architecture and Repository pattern
